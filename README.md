# Football Analysis Project
# Overview
This project aims to detect and track players, referees, and the football in video footage of football matches using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a powerful AI object detection model. Through this project, we delve into advanced techniques in computer vision and machine learning to extract meaningful insights from raw video data. By employing K-means clustering, optical flow, and perspective transformation, we enhance the model's ability to accurately measure player movements, team ball possession, and other crucial in-game metrics.

This project serves as a practical exercise in computer vision and AI, suitable for beginners aiming to deepen their understanding as well as for experienced engineers interested in real-world applications.

# Project Features
# Player, Referee, and Ball Detection

We utilize YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art deep learning object detection model, to identify and track players, referees, and the football. By training YOLO on custom data, we achieve higher accuracy tailored for football-specific contexts.

# Team Assignment Using K-means Clustering

Using K-means clustering for pixel segmentation, we differentiate players based on their team colors (e.g., their t-shirt colors). This segmentation process is essential for calculating team possession metrics, where we analyze which team controls the ball most frequently.

# Optical Flow for Camera Movement Detection

Optical flow techniques allow us to measure and compensate for the camera movement between frames. This is crucial for accurate player tracking, as it helps isolate player movement from camera movement, resulting in more precise positional data.

# Perspective Transformation

Perspective transformation is applied to adjust for depth and perspective within the scene. By transforming the frame view, we can estimate a player's movement in real-world metrics (meters) rather than pixels, offering more insightful and actionable data.

# Speed and Distance Measurement

With the transformed perspective, we calculate each player's speed and total distance covered during the game. This information is valuable for performance analysis, providing coaches and analysts with metrics on player endurance and positioning.

# Ball Possession Metrics

Combining the results from player detection, team assignment, and tracking data, we calculate the ball acquisition percentage for each team. This metric can reveal insights into a team's playing style, possession strategy, and overall dominance in the game.
